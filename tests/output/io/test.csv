Students who otherwise despise going to school and having to deal with their ailment will find a new found love for school and learning.

He or she would be focused on the gratification of his peers while distracting him from his schoolwork. If this student was taking a distance learning program he would not have to force himself through this unnecessary stress. This student would pick up on vital learning abilities needed in high school to help him succeed in his upcoming years. Otherwise, without this type of program, the student could miss out on important opportunities through the stress and turmoil of worrying about his peers and image.

Paris bans driving due to smog

Many days of pollution caused Paris to form a partial driving ban to help maintain air pollution. Not only that Paris ordered many motorists to leave there cars or be forced to pay a large fine of 22- euros or $31. Many did what was said and many did not, if they werent cooperating they would pay the fine and have the vehicle impounded.

Most of frances pollution came from the favored diesel, they had a tax policy that supported diesel instead of gasoline. Due to the favoring of Diesel making up 67 percent of the vehicle gas consumption.

France earned many complaints from companies world wide, delivery companies especially. They complained over lost revenue. Thats not all, because of this complaint France had to make a couple exceptions like Electric, hybrid vehicles and a Fee as free as a bird for the transit (Friday through Monday).

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on Abolishing the electoral college! They are not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency.

Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, the system allows for much worse.

Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy.) In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have nochance of winning.

While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable. The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers. High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling.
